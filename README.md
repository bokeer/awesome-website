#### What should I do with those resources?

People, including developers, designers, scientists and others, create awesome things every single day.
To be honest, we who are not superheroes, can't know all best things from the world. So, for saving your time,
I suggest you to pick those you like, take benefits from them, and finally put it into your kit. :smile:
